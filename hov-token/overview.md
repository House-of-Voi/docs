# $HoV Token Overview

> **Note**: This documentation is a work in progress. We're building House of Voi iteratively, and content will evolve based on community feedback, TestNet insights, and new learnings. Join us to shape the future!

$HoV is the native loyalty and incentive token of the House of Voi protocol. It powers a decentralized reward system that blends casino-style loyalty with crypto-native tokenomics, incentivizing player engagement, retention, and protocol growth.

## Core Principles

- **Earned Through Play**: $HoV is distributed via wagering, not speculation (e.g., 4 $HoV per $1 wagered).
- **Deflationary Mechanics**: Players burn $HoV to unlock/maintain loyalty tiers, reducing supply.
- **Utility-Driven**: Offers RTP boosts, jackpot eligibility, and future governance rights.
- **Game Integrity**: Operates outside core game math to preserve LP yields.

## Token Utility

- **Earning**: Based on wagering volume, with higher rates for volatile games.
- **Burn-to-Upgrade**: Burn $HoV for status tiers (e.g., Silver: 10,000 $HoV, +0.25% RTP).
- **Jackpot System**: Monthly progressive draws with 25% payout chance, requiring active status.
- **Future Perks**: Potential NFT cosmetics, exclusive games, or governance.
