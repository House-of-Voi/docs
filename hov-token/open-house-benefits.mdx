# Benefits of the Open House Model

> **Note**: This documentation is a work in progress. We are building House of Voi iteratively. Content will evolve based on community feedback, TestNet insights, and new learnings. Join us to shape the future.

## Introduction

The Open House model in House of Voi allows anyone to provide liquidity to specific games. This setup lets users own a share of a game's treasury. Users earn yields from the house edge. The model uses per-game liquidity pools.

## Key Benefits

1. **Incentivized Promotion and Viral Growth**  
   Liquidity providers who own a share of a specific game's house promote it to friends, communities, or audiences. This drives organic traffic and volume without centralized marketing costs. For example, a liquidity provider can share referral links on social media. The model encourages liquidity providers and players to share wins, yields, or custom events on platforms like X or Telegram. This creates a network effect for user acquisition.

2. **Per-Game Treasuries for Targeted Investments**  
   Each game operates as its own independent treasury with transparent stats like RTP, volume, volatility, and historical performance. Investors allocate capital to games that match their risk appetite. This includes high-volatility slots for big swings or steady dice games for consistent yields.

3. **Seamless Yield Earning for Players**  
   Gamblers deposit leftover funds into the liquidity pool of the game they are playing. This turns idle balances into potential yields. When they return, their stake may have grown from the house edge. This non-custodial feature encourages longer engagement without forcing users to cash out prematurely.

4. **Private or Custom Machines for Special Use Cases**  
   Users create or own private house machines tailored for events, influencers, or charities. Influencers run exclusive jackpots to engage followers. Charities replace traditional raffles with interactive games where the entire house edge supports their cause. This enables ongoing fundraisers with fun mechanics like progressive jackpots that build over time.

5. **Enhanced Transparency and Trust**  
   All game outcomes, yields, and treasury stats are verifiable on-chain. This eliminates black-box concerns common in centralized casinos. This provable fairness builds user confidence, reduces disputes, and attracts advantage players who value data-driven decisions.

6. **Risk Diversification and Customization**  
   Liquidity providers spread investments across multiple games or focus on niches. They diversify risk based on real-time analytics. Players benefit from customizable experiences such as integrating DeFi yields or NFT bonuses.

7. **Lower Barriers and Global Accessibility**  
   Anyone participates as a liquidity provider with small amounts. This democratizes access to casino yields without needing massive capital. Permissionless design enables borderless play subject to compliance. This opens markets underserved by traditional gambling.

8. **Sustainable Yields and Deflationary Mechanics**  
   Yields flow directly to liquidity providers from the house edge. This creates reliable income streams without relying on speculative tokens. Combined with burn mechanics in loyalty systems, this promotes long-term value and ecosystem health.

9. **Integration with Broader DeFi and Creator Tools**  
   Liquidity provider positions can be tokenized as NFTs or composable assets. This allows users to leverage them in DeFi such as collateral for loans on lending platforms. This bridges gambling with the wider crypto economy. It enables creators to bundle gaming with content or merchandise. Additionally, players can access leveraged betting by borrowing funds from DeFi protocols to place larger wagers. This increases potential returns with smaller initial capital but also amplifies losses due to the borrowed amounts. Lenders earn interest on the provided capital, distributing risk between gamblers and lenders. Such integrations are optional and include risks like liquidation in volatile markets, aligning with responsible gaming practices.

10. **Educational and Responsible Gaming Opportunities**  
    Transparent stats empower users to make informed choices. This potentially reduces problem gambling. Features like wager limits or self-exclusion can be enhanced with community input. This promotes a safer environment while educating on risk management.

## Conclusion

The Open House model uses a collaborative ecosystem. Users own, promote, and innovate. House of Voi uses decentralized entertainment.
