# Unified Loyalty & Incentive Mechanism

## Overview

The **$HoV token** powers the loyalty and incentive layer of the House of Voi protocol, connecting players and liquidity providers into a single aligned ecosystem.  

Unlike speculative tokens, $HoV is a **programmable loyalty engine**. It is earned through participation, burned to unlock status, and applied to unlock perks and influence within the casino.  

By combining proven casino loyalty design with crypto-native mechanics, $HoV creates a self-reinforcing cycle:  
- Play generates rewards  
- Rewards drive loyalty  
- Loyalty fuels long-term engagement for both players and liquidity providers  

<Info>
$HoV is not just a reward. It is the glue that binds players, liquidity providers, and the protocol into a sustainable economy.

## Core Principles

- **Participation-First Distribution**  
  $HoV enters circulation through usage such as wagering or liquidity provision. Those who engage are those who benefit.  

- **Burn-to-Status Commitment**  
  Users climb loyalty tiers by burning $HoV, with ongoing burns required to maintain status. This mirrors airline and credit card models that reward consistent engagement.  

- **Game-Integrated Utility**  
  $HoV unlocks features such as boosted win probabilities within fair limits, bonus spins, or “boost play” opportunities at higher tiers. These mechanics add excitement while preserving game integrity.  

- **Aligned with LP Yield**  
  Liquidity providers are rewarded with more than a share of the house edge. By staking $HoV alongside their liquidity, LPs reduce the protocol fee taken from their pool’s house edge. The more $HoV committed, the greater the share of yield retained by the LP.  

- **Prizes and Prestige**  
  Higher loyalty tiers grant access to prize pools, exclusive competitions, and prestige-driven benefits that elevate the player experience.

## Utility Pathways

### Earning $HoV

- **Players** earn $HoV through wagering activity.  
- **Liquidity providers** earn $HoV for supplying capital to game pools.  

The exact mechanics are dynamic and adapt to demand and scalability.

### Burning for Loyalty Status

Burning $HoV elevates a player or LP into higher loyalty tiers. Benefits include:  

- Enhanced odds or RTP boosts within controlled limits  
- Exclusive “boost play” benefits for top-tier members  
- Access to prize pools and private events  
- Prestige and recognition across the ecosystem  

Loyalty status decays without ongoing burns, encouraging sustained commitment.  

### Staking $HoV with Liquidity

Liquidity providers can stake $HoV into the pools they support. Staking reduces the protocol fee taken from that pool’s house edge, allowing LPs to capture a larger share of earnings. This creates a direct incentive for LPs to align long-term with the ecosystem.  

### Prestige and Future Expansion

Beyond gameplay benefits, $HoV unlocks additional utilities:  

- Cosmetic rewards, collectibles, and NFTs  
- Invitations to exclusive tournaments and events  
- Influence over protocol development and game integrations  
- Enhanced rewards for LPs who both stake capital and participate in gameplay  

<Warning>
Distribution mechanics for $HoV will evolve dynamically. They will be tuned based on live demand, scalability, and ecosystem health.

## Summary

$HoV is more than a token. It is a **programmable loyalty system** that ties together players and liquidity providers into a unified incentive engine.  

Through active earning, deflationary burns, staking-linked yield boosts, gameplay-linked perks, and prestige rewards, $HoV redefines casino loyalty in a decentralized world.  

This system drives sustained engagement, maintains fairness, and lays the foundation for the House of Voi ecosystem to scale into a global, player-owned gambling network.
