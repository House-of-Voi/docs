description: Overview of the \$HoV token, its utilities, tokenomics, and governance within the House of Voi protocol.

## Overview

The \$HoV token serves as the native loyalty and incentive token within the House of Voi protocol, a decentralized, liquidity-pooled gambling infrastructure. Engineered as both a reward mechanism and a deflationary asset, \$HoV is intrinsically linked to user engagement through wagering activities, loyalty progression, and participation in progressive jackpots. Distinct from conventional utility tokens, \$HoV merges proven casino loyalty strategies with cryptocurrency-native tokenomics, fostering a self-reinforcing cycle that encourages sustained play, loyalty, and user retention.

<Info>
\$HoV is designed to reward active participation, creating a sustainable ecosystem for players and liquidity providers.

## Core Principles

- **Earned Through Engagement, Not Speculation**: \$HoV is predominantly distributed via active participation in wagering, prioritizing genuine usage over passive holding or speculation.
- **Deflationary Mechanics via Burn-to-Status**: Users burn \$HoV to achieve and maintain loyalty tiers, systematically reducing the circulating supply and enhancing scarcity.
- **Utility-Driven Value Proposition**: The token's value is anchored in tangible benefits, including enhanced Return to Player (RTP) rates, jackpot eligibility, and prestige features.
- **Non-Interference with Core Game Integrity**: \$HoV operates independently of base RTP calculations, ensuring the preservation of liquidity provider (LP) yield integrity and fair game mathematics.

## Token Utility

## Earning \$HoV

Users accumulate \$HoV proportional to their wagering volume, incentivizing active gameplay.

- **Emission Rate**: Approximately 4 \$HoV per \$1 wagered (subject to protocol adjustments for balance and sustainability).
- **Volatility Scaling**: Games with higher volatility may feature adjusted emission rates to reward risk-taking while maintaining economic equilibrium.

## Burn-to-Upgrade System

To access elevated loyalty tiers, users burn \$HoV, unlocking enhanced perks. Tiers are time-bound (up to 12 months) and require periodic maintenance burns to prevent decay, promoting ongoing commitment.

| Tier    | Total Burn to Unlock | Quarterly Maintenance Burn | RTP Boost | Prestige Perks                  |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| Silver  | 10,000 \$HoV         | 2,500 \$HoV                | +0.25%   | 2 jackpot tickets per month    |
| Gold    | 50,000 \$HoV         | 10,000 \$HoV               | +0.50%   | 15 jackpot tickets per month   |
| Diamond | 200,000 \$HoV        | 25,000 \$HoV               | +1.00%   | 65 jackpot tickets per month   |
| Whale   | 1,000,000 \$HoV      | 100,000 \$HoV              | +1.25%   | 300 jackpot tickets per month  |

## Progressive Jackpot

A protocol-wide jackpot draws occur monthly, with a 25% probability of payout. Unclaimed prizes roll over, increasing future pools and excitement.

- **Eligibility**: Requires an active loyalty status tier.
- **Ticket Allocation**: Determined by burned \$HoV divided by a predefined threshold, augmented by tier-specific bonuses.
- **Funding Sources**: Derived from protocol revenues, frontend fees, or strategic token buybacks, ensuring sustainable growth.

## Prestige & Utilities

Beyond core mechanics, \$HoV unlocks prestige elements and future expansions:

- **Current and Planned Benefits**: NFT-based cosmetics, exclusive game modes, and protocol governance participation.
- **Optional Features**: Whale-tier exclusive tournaments, high-stakes games, or weighted voting in community decisions.

## Tokenomics and Distribution

**Fixed Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 \$HoV

| Allocation     | Percentage | Notes                                      |
|----------------|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Founders       | 10%       | 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff           |
| Team           | 10%       | 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff           |
| Investors      | 20%       | SAFT or convertible note with warrants     |
| Airdrop        | 5%        | Community campaigns and early LPs          |
| Player Emissions | 55%     | Distributed via wagering; emissions taper over time to maintain value |

- **Emission Schedule**: Gradual tapering to mitigate inflation and preserve long-term token value.
- **Deflationary Sinks**: Burn mechanics for status upgrades and maintenance act as perpetual supply reducers, counterbalancing emissions.

<Warning>
Emissions will taper over time to preserve token value, with burn mechanics acting as long-term sinks.
</Warning>

## Governance and Expansion

Governance features may evolve through \$HoV staking or loyalty-based mechanisms, empowering holders to influence protocol development.

- **Potential Expansions**:
  - Community-driven game integrations.
  - Allocation of jackpot funds.
  - Adjustments to RTP boosts or emission rates.
- **Long-Term Vision**: \$HoV holders could shape ecosystem growth, ensuring alignment between users, developers, and the protocol's decentralized ethos.

## Summary

\$HoV transcends traditional rewards tokens by functioning as a programmable loyalty engine. Through deflationary burns, measurable utilities, and alignment with player incentives, it establishes a crypto-native evolution of casino VIP programs. This design rewards commitment, fosters retention, and builds a sustainable ecosystem where active participants thrive.
