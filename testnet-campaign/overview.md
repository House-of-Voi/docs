# TestNet Campaign Overview

> **Note**: This documentation is a work in progress. We're building House of Voi iteratively, and content will evolve based on community feedback, TestNet insights, and new learnings. Join us to shape the future!

The House of Voi TestNet campaign validates core protocol mechanics, engages early users, and builds a Sybil-resistant community for the $HoV airdrop.

## Key Features

- **Non-Transferable Tokens**: Test $HoV for wagering, LP provision, and status burns.
- **Leaderboard**: Tracks $HoV earned/burned, with top players/LPs gaining airdrop priority.
- **Progressive Jackpot**: Monthly draws with 25% payout chance, offering rewards like NFTs or early access.
- **Airdrop Eligibility**: Requires KYC, same wallet, and meaningful participation (e.g., earn/burn thresholds).

## Timeline

- Week 1: Faucet opens, games launch.
- Week 2: Leaderboard and LP rewards activate.
- Week 4: First jackpot draw.
- End: Snapshot for airdrop eligibility.

_Content under developmentâ€”participation details and rewards to be expanded._
