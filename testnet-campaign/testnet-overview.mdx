title: Campaign Overview
description: An overview of the House of Voi TestNet campaign, designed to validate protocol mechanics, engage early users, and facilitate a secure airdrop.
---

## Purpose

The House of Voi TestNet campaign aims to validate core protocol mechanics, engage early users, and prepare for a secure, Sybil-resistant airdrop. This testing phase mirrors real gameplay behavior and loyalty logic using non-transferable TestNet tokens (\$tHoV). Participants can interact with the protocol in a simulated environment, providing valuable feedback while building eligibility for potential mainnet rewards based on their engagement.

<Info>
  The TestNet uses non-transferable \$tHoV tokens to simulate real-world interactions without actual value transfer. Participation does not guarantee any mainnet rewards, which are subject to protocol discretion and regulatory compliance.

## How to Participate

### Claim from Faucet

Participants can claim \$tHoV tokens from a faucet to begin testing.

- **Faucet Mechanism**: Users receive an initial allocation of \$tHoV for wagering in games.
- **Usage Limits**: Faucet access may be restricted or scaled based on user engagement to prevent abuse and encourage meaningful participation.

### Wager in Games

- **Gameplay Simulation**: Wager \$tHoV in available games to earn more tokens, mirroring mainnet mechanics.
- **Earning Rewards**: Accumulate \$tHoV through wins and participation, which contributes to leaderboard status and potential airdrop consideration.

### Provide Liquidity

Liquidity providers (LPs) can test the protocol by supplying simulated liquidity.

- **Rewards for LPs**: Receive a share of \$tHoV based on simulated yields from the house edge split.
- **Non-Transferable Rewards**: \$tHoV earned is non-transferable but counts toward leaderboard rankings and potential airdrop evaluation.
- **Incentives**: Encourages LPs to test liquidity mechanics and earn recognition during the TestNet phase.

## Status and Leaderboards

- **Loyalty Tiers**: Players can burn \$tHoV to unlock temporary status tiers, similar to mainnet.
- **Perks**: Status boosts RTP and grants progressive jackpot tickets during the campaign.
- **Leaderboard Tracking**: A live leaderboard monitors total \$tHoV earned, burned, and current status.
- **Priority Benefits**: Top players and LPs may receive priority consideration for airdrop eligibility and early mainnet access, based on their overall engagement.

## Progressive Jackpot

The TestNet includes a bi-weekly progressive jackpot to test reward distribution.

- **Draw Mechanics**: Every two weeks features a 25% chance of payout; unclaimed prizes roll over.
- **Eligibility and Tickets**: Earn tickets by burning \$tHoV for status tiers.
- **Prizes**: May include real-world rewards, NFTs, or early access benefits to incentivize participation.

<Warning>
  Jackpot prizes during TestNet are for engagement purposes and do not carry over to mainnet. All rewards are subject to terms and conditions.
</Warning>

## Airdrop Eligibility and Sybil Resistance

- **No Carryover**: TestNet \$tHoV does not transfer to mainnet and holds no intrinsic value.
- **Eligibility Criteria**: To be considered for the initial \$HoV airdrop on mainnet, participants must:
  - Complete KYC during mainnet launch.
  - Use the same wallet address as in TestNet.
  - Demonstrate meaningful participation, such as meeting thresholds for \$tHoV earned or burned.
- **Airdrop Determination**: The total \$tHoV accumulated through earning, burning, and overall engagement during the TestNet will be evaluated to determine potential airdrop allocation, at the protocol's discretion and in compliance with applicable regulations. This is intended to reward genuine testers and community contributors.
- **Anti-Sybil Measures**: Identity verification and participation thresholds ensure rewards are directed to authentic, engaged users, preventing multi-account abuse.

<Warning>
  Participation in the TestNet does not constitute an investment or guarantee of future rewards. All airdrop decisions are final and subject to legal and regulatory requirements.
</Warning>

## Timeline

The exact end date will be announced based on protocol readiness and feedback, but it is expected to span several months to ensure comprehensive validation.
