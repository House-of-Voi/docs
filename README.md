# House of Voi Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation repository for [House of Voi](https://dashboard.houseofvoi.com), a decentralized, liquidity-pooled gambling protocol built on immutable smart contracts. House of Voi redefines online gaming with transparent, non-custodial gameplay, a Web2-level user experience, and a loyalty system powered by the $HoV token.

## Work in Progress

This documentation is actively evolving as we build House of Voi in the open. We're following an iterative process, learning from community feedback, TestNet participation, and market insights. Information here is not set in stoneâ€”expect updates, refinements, and new content as we progress. Join us to shape the future of decentralized gambling by contributing ideas, feedback, or pull requests!

## About House of Voi

House of Voi combines the scale of online gambling with crypto-native infrastructure. Key features include:

- **Immutable Game Contracts**: Provably fair games with fixed RTP and logic.
- **Liquidity Pools**: Players and LPs earn from the house edge, with permissionless withdrawals.
- **$HoV Token**: A loyalty and incentive token earned through wagering, used for status tiers and jackpot eligibility.
- **TestNet Campaign**: Early adopters can test mechanics and earn airdrop eligibility.
