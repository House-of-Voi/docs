# House of Voi: Permissionless Gambling Protocol

> **Note**: This documentation is a work in progress. We are building House of Voi iteratively. Content will evolve based on community feedback, TestNet insights, and new learnings. Join us to shape the future.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What is House of Voi?

House of Voi (HoV) is a permissionless gambling protocol. It uses immutable smart contracts and community-backed liquidity pools. This setup removes the centralization found in traditional casinos. Players bet against on-chain game logic that is provably fair. Anyone can provide liquidity to back specific games and earn from the house edge. This means regular people can act as the house for individual games, like owning their own slot machine or roulette table. Liquidity providers are incentivized to market their games to attract more players and increase their earnings, similar to how creators on platforms like OnlyFans promote their content to build an audience and revenue.

HoV offers classic casino games such as slots, dice, and roulette. It also supports crypto features. The protocol is open, so developers can build on it or integrate it.

### 1.2 Why Now?

The online gambling market is projected to reach about $100 billion annually. Crypto adoption is over 500 million users worldwide. Regulations are becoming clearer.

Traditional platforms hold user funds, lack transparency, and use outdated loyalty systems. HoV uses blockchain to address these issues. The protocol handles the backend. The frontend makes it easy to use, without needing to manage wallets, gas fees, or chains. It feels like a standard web casino but runs on-chain.

HoV is for all gamblers who want fair play and ownership. It includes responsible gaming tools like self-exclusion and wager limits.

### 1.3 What Sets House of Voi Apart?

HoV solves key problems with permissionless design. Here is how it compares.

**Compared to Centralized Casinos**
- Non-custodial funds: Users control their money.
- Transparent math: Outcomes are verifiable on-chain.
- Immutable contracts: Rules cannot change.
- Shared ownership: Anyone can provide liquidity and earn.

**Compared to Other Crypto Casinos**
- Per-game liquidity vaults: Earnings go to liquidity providers, not a central treasury.
- Burn-to-status loyalty: Rewards long-term play.
- Easy interface: Web2-level UX with on-chain security.
- Open design: Supports integrations like DeFi or NFTs.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Immutable Game Contracts

Each game is a standalone smart contract. It has no upgrades or admin keys. RTP, volatility, and logic are set at deployment.

### 2.2 Liquidity Pools

Each game has its own vault. Anyone can deposit capital to become a liquidity provider. They set max bet limits and earn from the house edge. Withdrawals are instant. Since pools are per-game, providers can focus on specific games they like. They can promote those games to draw in players, boosting volume and their yields. This turns providers into active participants who market their own "machines."

### 2.3 Frontend Interface

The frontend is non-custodial. It hides blockchain details. It offers easy onboarding and Web2 UX. All actions go to on-chain contracts. A licensed entity runs it for KYC and compliance. It takes a fixed share of the house edge.

### 2.4 Game Flow Summary

1. Player bets into a game contract.
2. Outcome and payout happen on-chain.
3. House edge splits between liquidity providers and frontend.
4. Players earn $HoV based on bet volume.

## 3. Token Design: $HoV

### 3.1 Purpose

$HoV is the utility token for loyalty and incentives. It supports:
- Tier progression.
- RTP boosts.
- Jackpot entry.
- Governance rights.

It rewards activity without affecting game math or provider yields.

### 3.2 How It Works

- Earn: Get $HoV from betting (example: 4 per $1 wagered, adjustable).
- Burn: Use $HoV to reach and keep tiers.
- Perks: Tiers give RTP boosts and jackpot tickets.
- Trade: $HoV transfers on mainnet. Testnet tHoV does not.

### 3.3 Loyalty Tier System

| Tier    | Burn to Unlock | Quarterly Burn | RTP Boost | Jackpot Tickets/Month |
|---------|----------------|----------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| Silver  | 10,000 $HoV    | 2,500 $HoV     | +0.25%    | 2                     |
| Gold    | 50,000 $HoV    | 10,000 $HoV    | +0.50%    | 15                    |
| Diamond | 200,000 $HoV   | 25,000 $HoV    | +1.00%    | 65                    |
| Whale   | 1,000,000 $HoV | 100,000 $HoV   | +1.25%    | 300                   |

Tiers last up to 12 months. Quarterly burns prevent decay.

### 3.4 Jackpot System

Each game features its own progressive jackpot. It builds over time from a portion of the house edge. Payouts trigger based on game-specific probabilities. It rolls over if not won. Funded by protocol earnings. Tickets come from burned $HoV plus tier bonuses. Active status required.

### 3.5 Tokenomics

Tokenomics are a work in progress.

## 4. Testnet & Launch Strategy

### 4.1 tHoV System

tHoV is non-transferable. Earn it from faucets and games. It qualifies for mainnet airdrop. Claims need KYC to stop abuse.

### 4.2 Launch Objectives

- Use leaderboards for engagement.
- Test contracts and math.
- Build KYC-ready user list.
- Track responsible gaming data.

## 5. Compliance Strategy

Protocol is immutable and decentralized. Frontend handles KYC and rules. Launch in places like Curacao. Use geo-fencing and self-exclusion.

## 6. Team

House of Voi is led by Christopher Swenor, a seasoned entrepreneur and blockchain innovator with over 25 years of experience in software development, product acceleration, and launching funded ventures. Starting his career as a developer in 2000, Swenor has founded and scaled multiple companies, many of which have been successfully acquired, demonstrating his ability to build value in competitive tech landscapes.

Swenor's blockchain expertise includes founding Voi Network in 2023, a high-performance, community-owned Layer 1 blockchain built on Algorand Virtual Machine (AVM) technology. He co-founded Reach Platform in 2021, a tool that simplifies smart contract development for Web3 builders; Humble Decentralized Exchange (Humble DeFi) in 2022, which merged with Pact Finance in 2024 to become a leading DEX on Algorand and Voi; and playAlloy in 2024, a gaming-blockchain project acquired shortly before launch. Earlier, he founded East Coast Product in 2015, a product accelerator later acquired, and served as CTO at Vsnap from 2018 to 2021, overseeing its acquisition by Gainsight.

From 2018 to 2020, Swenor was a Technologist in Residence at Harvard Business School, advising on emerging technologies and mentoring in blockchain-business intersections. Known for his collaborative leadership and ability to bridge technical and non-technical worlds, Swenor is actively expanding the HoV team with specialists in smart contracts, regulatory compliance, and user experience to realize the protocol's full potential.
